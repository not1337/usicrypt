usicrypt, a unified simple interface crypto library wrapper

License:
You may include this code in any project as long as the project is
licensed only by one or more OSI approved licenses, e.g. you cannot
include this code in any project with an OSI approved and a commercial
license.

See https://opensource.org/licenses for the list of applicable licenses.

The only exception to the above rule is a project that is put in the
public domain. In this case you have to pick a proper OSI approved
license for the usicrypt code only, i.e. you cannot put the usicrypt
code in the public domain.

And, well, yes, it is up to you to ensure that the licence you pick for
your project is compatible with the crypto library you do actually select.
